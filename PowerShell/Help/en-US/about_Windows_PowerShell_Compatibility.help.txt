Short description

Describes the Windows PowerShell Compatibility functionality for PowerShell
7.


Long description

Unless the module manifest indicates that module is compatible with
PowerShell Core, modules in the
%windir%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules folder are loaded in a
background Windows PowerShell 5.1 process by Windows PowerShell
Compatibility feature.

Using the Compatibility feature

When the first module is imported using Windows PowerShell Compatibility
feature, PowerShell creates a remote session named WinPSCompatSession that
is running in a background Windows PowerShell 5.1 process. This process is
created when the Compatibility feature imports the first module. The
process is closed when the last such module is removed (using
Remove-Module) or when PowerShell process exits.

The modules loaded in the WinPSCompatSession session are used via implicit
remoting and reflected into current PowerShell session. This is the same
transport method used for PowerShell jobs.

When a module is imported into the WinPSCompatSession session, implicit
remoting generates a proxy module in the user's $env:Temp directory and
imports this proxy module into current PowerShell session. This allows
PowerShell to detect that the module was loaded using Windows PowerShell
Compatibility functionality.

Once the session is created, it can be used for operations that don't work
correctly on deserialized objects. The entire pipeline is executed in
Windows PowerShell and only the final result is returned. For example:

    $s = Get-PSSession -Name WinPSCompatSession
    Invoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock {
      "Running in Windows PowerShell version $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion)"
    }

The Compatibility feature can be invoked in two ways:

-   Explicitly by importing a module using the USEWINDOWSPOWERSHELL
    parameter

        Import-Module -Name ScheduledTasks -UseWindowsPowerShell

-   Implicitly by importing a Windows PowerShell module by module name,
    path, or autoloading via command discovery.

        Import-Module -Name ServerManager
        Get-AppLockerPolicy -Local

    If not already loaded, the AppLocker module is autoloaded when you run
    Get-AppLockerPolicy.

Windows PowerShell Compatibility blocks loading of modules that are listed
in the WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityModuleDenyList setting in PowerShell
configuration file.

The default value of this setting is:

    "WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityModuleDenyList":  [
       "PSScheduledJob","BestPractices","UpdateServices"
    ]

Managing implicit module loading

To disable implicit import behavior of the Windows PowerShell Compatibility
feature, use the DisableImplicitWinCompat setting in a PowerShell
configuration file. This setting can be added to the powershell.config.json
file. For more information, see about_powershell_config.

This example shows how to create a configuration file that disables the
implicit module-loading feature of Windows PowerShell Compatibility.

    $ConfigPath = "$PSHOME\DisableWinCompat.powershell.config.json"
    $ConfigJSON = ConvertTo-Json -InputObject @{
      "DisableImplicitWinCompat" = $true
      "Microsoft.PowerShell:ExecutionPolicy" = "RemoteSigned"
    }
    $ConfigJSON | Out-File -Force $ConfigPath
    pwsh -settingsFile $ConfigPath

PowerShell 7 module compatibility list.

Managing cmdlet clobbering

The Windows PowerShell Compatibility feature uses implicit remoting to load
modules in compatibility mode. The result is that commands exported by the
module take precedence over commands of the same name in the current
PowerShell 7 session. In the PowerShell 7.0.0 release, this included the
core modules that ship with PowerShell.

In PowerShell 7.1, the behavior was changed so that the following core
PowerShell modules are not clobbered:

-   Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost
-   Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics
-   Microsoft.PowerShell.Host
-   Microsoft.PowerShell.Management
-   Microsoft.PowerShell.Security
-   Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
-   Microsoft.WSMan.Management

PowerShell 7.1 also added the ability to list additional modules that
should not be clobbered by compatibility mode.

You can add the WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityNoClobberModuleList setting
to PowerShell configuration file. The value of this setting is a
comma-separated list of module names. The default value of this setting is:

    "WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityNoClobberModuleList": [ ]


Limitations

The Windows PowerShell Compatibility functionality:

1.  Only works locally on Windows computers
2.  Requires that Windows PowerShell 5.1
3.  Operates on serialized cmdlet parameters and return values, not on live
    objects
4.  All modules imported into the Windows PowerShell remoting session share
    the same runspace.
