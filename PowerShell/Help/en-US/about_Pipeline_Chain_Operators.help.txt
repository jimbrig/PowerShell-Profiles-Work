ABOUT_PIPELINE_CHAIN_OPERATORS


Short description

Describes chaining pipelines with the && and || operators in PowerShell.


Long description

Beginning in PowerShell 7, PowerShell implements the && and || operators to
conditionally chain pipelines. These operators are known in PowerShell as
_pipeline chain operators_, and are similar to AND-OR lists in POSIX shells
like bash, zsh and sh, as well as conditional processing symbols in the
Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe).

The && operator executes the right-hand pipeline, if the left-hand pipeline
succeeded. Conversely, the || operator executes the right-hand pipeline if
the left-hand pipeline failed.

These operators use the $? and $LASTEXITCODE variables to determine if a
pipeline failed. This allows you to use them with native commands and not
just with cmdlets or functions. For example:

    # Create an SSH key pair - if successful copy the public key to clipboard
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 && Get-Content -Raw ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip

Examples

Two successful commands

    Write-Output 'First' && Write-Output 'Second'

    First
    Second

First command fails, causing second not to be executed

    Write-Error 'Bad' && Write-Output 'Second'

    Write-Error: Bad

First command succeeds, so the second command is not executed

    Write-Output 'First' || Write-Output 'Second'

    First

First command fails, so the second command is executed

    Write-Error 'Bad' || Write-Output 'Second'

    Write-Error: Bad
    Second

Pipeline success is defined by the value of the $? variable, which
PowerShell automatically sets after executing a pipeline based on its
execution status. This means that pipeline chain operators have the
following equivalence:

    Test-Command '1' && Test-Command '2'

works the same as

    Test-Command '1'; if ($?) { Test-Command '2' }

and

    Test-Command '1' || Test-Command '2'

works the same as

    Test-Command '1'; if (-not $?) { Test-Command '2' }

Assignment from pipeline chains

Assigning a variable from a pipeline chain takes the concatenation of all
the pipelines in the chain:

    $result = Write-Output '1' && Write-Output '2'
    $result

    1
    2

If a script-terminating error occurs during assignment from a pipeline
chain, the assignment does not succeed:

    try
    {
        $result = Write-Output 'Value' && $(throw 'Bad')
    }
    catch
    {
        # Do nothing, just squash the error
    }

    "Result: $result"

    Result:

Operator syntax and precedence

Unlike other operators, && and || operate on pipelines, rather than on
expressions like + or -and, for example.

&& and || have a lower precedence than piping (|) or redirection (>), but a
higher precedence than job operators (&), assignment (=) or semicolons (;).
This means that pipelines within a pipeline chain can be individually
redirected, and that entire pipeline chains can be backgrounded, assigned
to variables, or separated as statements.

To use lower precedence syntax within a pipeline chain, consider the use of
parentheses (...). Similarly, to embed a statement within a pipeline chain,
a subexpression $(...) can be used. This can be useful for combining native
commands with control flow:

    foreach ($file in 'file1','file2','file3')
    {
        # When find succeeds, the loop breaks
        find $file && Write-Output "Found $file" && $(break)
    }

    find: file1: No such file or directory
    file2
    Found file2

As of PowerShell 7, the behaviour of these syntaxes has been changed so
that $? is set as expected when a command succeeds or fails within
parentheses or a subexpression.

Like most other operators in PowerShell, && and || are also
_left-associative_, meaning they group from the left. For example:

    Get-ChildItem -Path ./file.txt || Write-Error "file.txt does not exist" && Get-Content -Raw ./file.txt

will group as:

    [Get-ChildItem -Path ./file.txt || Write-Error "file.txt does not exist"] && Get-Content -Raw ./file.txt

being equivalent to:

    Get-ChildItem -Path ./file.txt

    if (-not $?) { Write-Error "file.txt does not exist" }

    if ($?) { Get-Content -Raw ./file.txt }

Error interaction

Pipeline chain operators do not absorb errors. When a statement in a
pipeline chain throws a script-terminating error, the pipeline chain is
terminated.

For example:

    $(throw 'Bad') || Write-Output '2'

    Exception: Bad

Even when the error is caught, the pipeline chain is still terminated:

    try
    {
        $(throw 'Bad') || Write-Output '2'
    }
    catch
    {
        Write-Output "Caught: $_"
    }
    Write-Output 'Done'

    Caught: Bad
    Done

If an error is non-terminating, or only terminates a pipeline, the pipeline
chain continues, respecting the value of $?:

    function Test-NonTerminatingError
    {
        [CmdletBinding()]
        param()

        $exception = [System.Exception]::new('BAD')
        $errorId = 'BAD'
        $errorCategory = 'NotSpecified'

        $errorRecord = [System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord]::new($exception, $errorId, $errorCategory, $null)

        $PSCmdlet.WriteError($errorRecord)
    }

    Test-NonTerminatingError || Write-Output 'Second'

    Test-NonTerminatingError: BAD
    Second

Chaining pipelines rather than commands

Pipeline chain operators, by their name, can be used to chain pipelines,
rather than just commands. This matches the behavior of other shells, but
can make _success_ harder to determine:

    function Test-NotTwo
    {
        [CmdletBinding()]
        param(
          [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline)]
          $Input
        )

        process
        {
            if ($Input -ne 2)
            {
                return $Input
            }

            $exception = [System.Exception]::new('Input is 2')
            $errorId = 'InputTwo'
            $errorCategory = 'InvalidData'

            $errorRecord = [System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord]::new($exception, $errorId, $errorCategory, $null)

            $PSCmdlet.WriteError($errorRecord)
        }
    }

    1,2,3 | Test-NotTwo && Write-Output 'All done!'

    1
    Test-NotTwo : Input is 2
    3

Note that Write-Output 'All done!' is not executed, since Test-NotTwo is
deemed to have failed after generating the non-terminating error.
