Short description

Provides access to X.509 certificate stores and certificates in PowerShell.


Detailed description

The PowerShell CERTIFICATE provider lets you get, add, change, clear, and
delete certificates and certificate stores in PowerShell.

The CERTIFICATE drive is a hierarchical namespace containing the
certificate stores and certificates on your computer.

The CERTIFICATE provider supports the following cmdlets, which are covered
in this article.

-   Get-Location
-   Set-Location
-   Get-Item
-   Get-ChildItem
-   Invoke-Item
-   Move-Item
-   New-Item
-   Remove-Item
-   Get-ItemProperty
-   Set-ItemProperty
-   Clear-ItemProperty
-   Get-AuthenticodeSignature
-   Set-AuthenticodeSignature


Types exposed by this provider

The Certificate drive exposes the following types.

-   Store locations (Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.X509StoreLocation),
    which are high-level containers that group the certificates for the
    current user and for all users. Each system has a CurrentUser and
    LocalMachine (all users) store location.

-   Certificates stores
    (System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store), which are
    physical stores in which certificates are saved and managed.

-   X.509 SYSTEM.SECURITY.CRYPTOGRAPHY.X509CERTIFICATES.X509CERTIFICATE2
    certificates, each of which represent an X.509 certificate on the
    computer. Certificates are identified by their thumbprints.


Navigating the Certificate drive

The CERTIFICATE provider exposes the certificate namespace as the Cert:
drive in PowerShell. This command uses the Set-Location command to change
the current location to the Root certificate store in the LocalMachine
store location. Use a backslash (\) or a forward slash (/) to indicate a
level of the Cert: drive.

    Set-Location Cert:

You can also work with the certificate provider from any other PowerShell
drive. To reference an alias from another location, use the Cert: drive
name in the path.

    PS Cert:\> Set-Location -Path LocalMachine\Root

To return to a file system drive, type the drive name. For example, type:

    Set-Location C:

  [!NOTE] PowerShell uses aliases to allow you a familiar way to work with
  provider paths. Commands such as dir and ls are now aliases for
  Get-ChildItem, cd is an alias for Set-Location. and pwd is an alias for
  Get-Location.


Displaying the Contents of the Cert: drive

This command uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to display the certificate
stores in the CurrentUser certificate store location.

If you are not in the Cert: drive, use an absolute path.

    PS Cert:\CurrentUser\> Get-ChildItem

Displaying certificate properties within the Cert: drive

This example gets a certificate with Get-Item and stores it in a variable.
The example shows the new certificate script properties (DNSNAMELIST,
ENHANCEDKEYUSAGELIST, SENDASTRUSTEDISSUER) using Select-Object.

    $c = Get-Item cert:\LocalMachine\My\52A149D0393CE8A8D4AF0B172ED667A9E3A1F44E
    $c | Format-List DnsNameList, EnhancedKeyUsageList, SendAsTrustedIssuer

    DnsNameList          : {SERVER01.contoso.com}
    EnhancedKeyUsageList : {WiFi-Machine (1.3.6.1.4.1.311.42.2.6),
                           Client Authentication (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2)}
    SendAsTrustedIssuer  : False

Find all CodeSigning certificates

This command uses the CODESIGNINGCERT and RECURSE parameters of the
Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get all of the certificates on the computer that
have code-signing authority.

    Get-ChildItem -Path cert: -CodeSigningCert -Recurse

Find expired certificates

This command uses the EXPIRINGINDAYS parameter of the Get-ChildItem cmdlet
to get certificates that will expire within the next 30 days.

    Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting -ExpiringInDays 30

Find Server SSL Certificates

This command uses the SSLSERVERAUTHENTICATION parameter of the
Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get all Server SSL Certificates in the My and
WebHosting stores.

    Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My, cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting `
      -SSLServerAuthentication

Find expired certificates on remote computers

This command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Get-ChildItem command
on the Srv01 and Srv02 computers. A value of zero (0) in the EXPIRINGINDAYS
parameter gets certificates on the Srv01 and Srv02 computers that have
expired.

    Invoke-Command -ComputerName Srv01, Srv02 {Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\* `
      -Recurse -ExpiringInDays 0}

Combining filters to find a specific set of certificates

This command gets all certificates in the LocalMachine store location that
have the following attributes:

-   "fabrikam" in their DNS name
-   "Client Authentication" in their EKU
-   a value of $true for the SENDASTRUSTEDISSUER property
-   do not expire within the next 30 days.

The NOTAFTER property stores the certificate expiration date.

    [DateTime] $ValidThrough = (Get-Date) + (New-TimeSpan -Days 30)
    Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\* -Recurse -DNSName "*fabrikam*" `
      -EKU "*Client Authentication*" | Where-Object {
                                         $_.SendAsTrustedIssuer -and `
                                         $_.NotAfter -gt $ValidThrough
                                       }


Opening the Certificates MMC Snap-in

The Invoke-Item cmdlet will use the default application to open a path you
specify. For certificates, the default application is the Certificates MMC
snap-in.

This command opens the Certificates MMC snap-in to manage the specified
certificate.

    Invoke-Item cert:\CurrentUser\my\6B8223358119BB08840DEE50FD8AF9EA776CE66B


Copying Certificates

Copying certificates is not supported by the CERTIFICATE provider. When you
attempt to copy a certificate, you see this error.

    $path = "Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\E2C0F6662D3C569705B4B31FE2CBF3434094B254"
    PS Cert:\LocalMachine\> Copy-Item -Path $path -Destination .\CA\
    Copy-Item : Provider operation stopped because the provider does not support
    this operation.
    At line:1 char:1
    + Copy-Item -Path $path -Destination .\CA\
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo          : NotImplemented: (:) [Copy-Item],

        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NotSupported,
                                  Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.CopyItemCommand


Moving Certificates

Move all SSL Server authentication certs to the WebHosting store

This command uses the Move-Item cmdlet to move a certificate from the My
store to the WebHosting store.

Move-Item will not move certificate stores and it will not move
certificates to a different store location, such as moving a certificate
from LocalMachine to CurrentUser. The Move-Item cmdlet moves certificates,
but it does not move private keys.

This command uses the SSLSERVERAUTHENTICATION parameter of the
Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get SSL server authentication certificates in the
MY certificate store.

The returned certificates are piped to the Move-Item cmdlet, which moves
the certificates to the WebHosting store.

    Get-ChildItem cert:\LocalMachine\My -SSLServerAuthentication | Move-Item `
      -Destination cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting


Deleting Certificates and Private Keys

The Remove-Item cmdlet will remove certificates that you specify. The
-DeleteKey dynamic parameter deletes the private key.

Delete a Certificate from the CA store

This command deletes a certificate from the CA certificate store, but
leaves the associated private key intact.

In the Cert: drive, the Remove-Item cmdlet supports only the DELETEKEY,
PATH, WHATIF, and CONFIRM parameters. All other parameters are ignored.

    Remove-Item cert:\LocalMachine\CA\5DDC44652E62BF9AA1116DC41DE44AB47C87BDD0

Delete a Certificate using a wildcards in the DNS name

This command deletes all certificates that have a DNS name that contains
"Fabrikam". It uses the DNSNAME parameter of the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to
get the certificates and the Remove-Item cmdlet to delete them.

    Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\LocalMachine -DnsName *Fabrikam* | Remove-Item

Delete private keys from a remote computer

This series of commands enables delegation and then deletes the certificate
and associated private key on a remote computer. To delete a private key on
a remote computer, you must use delegated credentials.

Use the Enable-WSManCredSSP cmdlet to enable Credential Security Service
Provider (CredSSP) authentication on a client on the S1 remote computer.
CredSSP permits delegated authentication.

    Enable-WSManCredSSP -Role Client -DelegateComputer S1

Use the Connect-WSMan cmdlet to connect the S1 computer to the WinRM
service on the local computer. When this command completes, the S1 computer
appears in the local WSMan: drive in PowerShell.

    Connect-WSMan -ComputerName S1 -Credential Domain01\Admin01

Now, you can use the Set-Item cmdlet in the WSMan: drive to enable the
CredSSP attribute for the WinRM service.

    Set-Item -Path WSMan:\S1\Service\Auth\CredSSP -Value $true

Start a remote session on the s1 computer using the New-PSSession cmdlet,
and specify CredSSP authentication. Saves the session in the $s variable.

    $s  = New-PSSession S1 -Authentication CredSSP -Credential Domain01\Admin01

Finally, use the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Remove-Item command in the
session in the $s variable. The Remove-Item command uses the DELETEKEY
parameter to remove the private key along with the specified certificate.

    Invoke-Command -Session $s { Remove-Item `
      -Path cert:\LocalMachine\My\D2D38EBA60CAA1C12055A2E1C83B15AD450110C2 `
      -DeleteKey
      }

Delete expired Certificates

This command uses the EXPIRINGINDAYS parameter of the Get-ChildItem cmdlet
with a value of 0 to get certificates in the WebHosting store that have
expired.

The variable containing the returned certificates is piped to the
Remove-Item cmdlet, which deletes them. The command uses the DELETEKEY
parameter to delete the private key along with the certificate.

    $expired = Get-ChildItem cert:\LocalMachine\WebHosting -ExpiringInDays 0
    $expired | Remove-Item -DeleteKey


Creating Certificates

The New-Item cmdlet does not create new certificates in the CERTIFICATE
provider. Use the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet to create a certificate
for testing purposes.


Creating Certificate Stores

In the Cert: drive, the New-Item cmdlet creates certificate stores in the
LocalMachine store location. It supports the NAME, PATH, WHATIF, and
CONFIRM parameters. All other parameters are ignored. The command returns a
SYSTEM.SECURITY.CRYPTOGRAPHY.X509CERTIFICATES.X509STORE that represents the
new certificate store.

This command creates a new certificate store named "CustomStore" in the
LocalMachine store location.

    New-Item -Path cert:\LocalMachine\CustomStore

Create a new certificate store on a remote computer

This command creates a new certificate store named "HostingStore" in the
LocalMachine store location on the Server01 computer.

The command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a New-Item command on the
Server01 computer. The command returns a
SYSTEM.SECURITY.CRYPTOGRAPHY.X509CERTIFICATES.X509STORE that represents the
new certificate store.

    Invoke-Command { New-Item -Path cert:\LocalMachine\CustomStore } `
      -ComputerName Server01


Creating Client Certificates for WS-Man

This command creates CLIENTCERTIFICATE entry that can be used by the
WS-MANAGEMENT client. The new CLIENTCERTIFICATE will show up under the
CLIENTCERTIFICATE directory as "ClientCertificate_1234567890". All of the
parameters are mandatory. The ISSUER needs to be thumbprint of the issuers
certificate.

    $cred = Get-Credential
    New-Item -Path WSMan:\localhost\ClientCertificate `
             -Issuer 1b3fd224d66c6413fe20d21e38b304226d192dfe `
             -URI wmicimv2/* -Credential $cred


Deleting Certificate Stores

Delete a certificate store from a remote computer

This command uses the Invoke-Command cmdlet to run a Remove-Item command on
the S1 and S2 computers. The Remove-Item command includes the RECURSE
parameter, which deletes the certificates in the store before it deletes
the store.

    Invoke-Command { Remove-Item -Path cert:\LocalMachine\TestStore -Recurse } `
      -ComputerName S1, S2


Dynamic parameters

Dynamic parameters are cmdlet parameters that are added by a PowerShell
provider and are available only when the cmdlet is being used in the
provider-enabled drive. These parameters are valid in all subdirectories of
the Certificate provider, but are effective only on certificates.

  [!NOTE] Parameters that perform filtering against the
  EnhancedKeyUsageList property also return items with an empty
  EnhancedKeyUsageList property value. Certificates that have an empty
  ENHANCEDKEYUSAGELIST can be used for all purposes.

The following Certificate provider parameters were reintroduced in
PowerShell 7.1.

-   DNSName
-   DocumentEncryptionCert
-   EKU
-   ExpiringInDays
-   SSLServerAuthentication

CodeSigningCert <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

Cmdlets supported

-   Get-Item

-   Get-ChildItem

This parameter gets certificates that have "Code Signing" in their
ENHANCEDKEYUSAGELIST property value.

DeleteKey <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

Cmdlets supported

-   Remove-Item

This parameter deletes the associated private key when it deletes the
certificate.

  [!IMPORTANT] To delete a private key that is associated with a user
  certificate in the Cert:\CurrentUser store on a remote computer, you must
  use delegated credentials. The Invoke-Command cmdlet supports credential
  delegation using the CREDSSP parameter. You should consider any security
  risks before using Remove-Item with Invoke-Command and credential
  delegation.

This parameter was reintroduced in PowerShell 7.1

DnsName <Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.DnsNameRepresentation>

Cmdlets supported

-   Get-ChildItem

This parameter gets certificates that have the specified domain name or
name pattern in the DNSNAMELIST property of the certificate. The value of
this parameter can either be "Unicode" or "ASCII". Punycode values are
converted to Unicode. Wildcard characters (*) are permitted.

This parameter was reintroduced in PowerShell 7.1

DocumentEncryptionCert <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

Cmdlets supported

-   Get-Item

-   Get-ChildItem

This parameter gets certificates that have "Document Encryption" in their
ENHANCEDKEYUSAGELIST property value.

EKU <System.String>

Cmdlets supported

-   Get-ChildItem

This parameter gets certificates that have the specified text or text
pattern in the EnhancedKeyUsageList property of the certificate. Wildcard
characters (*) are permitted. The EnhancedKeyUsageList property contains
the friendly name and the OID fields of the EKU.

This parameter was reintroduced in PowerShell 7.1

ExpiringInDays <System.Int32>

Cmdlets supported

-   Get-ChildItem

This parameter gets certificates that are expiring in or before the
specified number of days. A value of 0 (zero) gets certificates that have
expired.

This parameter was reintroduced in PowerShell 7.1

ItemType <String>

This parameter allows you to specify the type of item created by New-Item.

In a Certificate drive, the following values are allowed:

-   Certificate Provider
-   Certificate
-   Store
-   StoreLocation

Cmdlets Supported

-   New-Item

SSLServerAuthentication <System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter>

Cmdlets supported

-   Get-ChildItem

Gets only server certificates for SSL web hosting. This parameter gets
certificates that have "Server Authentication" in their
EnhancedKeyUsageList property value.

This parameter was reintroduced in PowerShell 7.1


Script properties

New script properties have been added to the X509CERTIFICATE2 object that
represents the certificates to make it easy to search and manage the
certificates.

-   DnsNameList: To populate the DnsNameList property, the Certificate
    provider copies the content from the DNSName entry in the
    SubjectAlternativeName (SAN) extension. If the SAN extension is empty,
    the property is populated with content from the Subject field of the
    certificate.

-   EnhancedKeyUsageList: To populate the EnhancedKeyUsageList property,
    the Certificate provider copies the OID properties of the
    EnhancedKeyUsage (EKU) field in the certificate and creates a friendly
    name for it.

-   SendAsTrustedIssuer: To populate the SendAsTrustedIssuer property, the
    Certificate provider copies the SendAsTrustedIssuer property from the
    certificate. For more information see Management of trusted issuers for
    client authentication.

These new features let you search for certificates based on their DNS names
and expiration dates, and distinguish client and server authentication
certificates by the value of their Enhanced Key Usage (EKU) properties.


Using the pipeline

Provider cmdlets accept pipeline input. You can use the pipeline to
simplify task by sending provider data from one cmdlet to another provider
cmdlet. To read more about how to use the pipeline with provider cmdlets,
see the cmdlet references provided throughout this article.


Getting help

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, you can get customized help topics for
provider cmdlets that explain how those cmdlets behave in a file system
drive.

To get the help topics that are customized for the file system drive, run a
Get-Help command in a file system drive or use the -Path parameter of
Get-Help to specify a file system drive.

    Get-Help Get-ChildItem

    Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Path cert:
