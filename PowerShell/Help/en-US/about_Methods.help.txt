Short description

Describes how to use methods to perform actions on objects in PowerShell.


Long description

PowerShell uses objects to represent the items in data stores or the state
of the computer. For example, FileInfo objects represent the files in file
system drives and ProcessInfo objects represent the processes on the
computer.

Objects have properties, which store data about the object, and methods
that let you change the object.

A "method" is a set of instructions that specify an action you can perform
on the object. For example, the FileInfo object includes the CopyTo method
that copies the file that the FileInfo object represents.

To get the methods of any object, use the Get-Member cmdlet. Use its
MEMBERTYPE property with a value of "Method". The following command gets
the methods of process objects.

    Get-Process | Get-Member -MemberType Method

    TypeName: System.Diagnostics.Process

    Name                      MemberType Definition
    ----                      ---------- ----------
    BeginErrorReadLine        Method     System.Void BeginErrorReadLine()
    BeginOutputReadLine       Method     System.Void BeginOutputReadLine()
    ...
    Kill                      Method     System.Void Kill()
    Refresh                   Method     System.Void Refresh()
    Start                     Method     bool Start()
    ToString                  Method     string ToString()
    WaitForExit               Method     bool WaitForExit(int milliseconds), ...
    WaitForInputIdle          Method     bool WaitForInputIdle(int millisecon...

To perform or "invoke" a method of an object, type a dot (.), the method
name, and a set of parentheses "()". If the method has arguments, place the
argument values inside the parentheses. The parentheses are required for
every method call, even when there are no arguments. If the method takes
multiple arguments, they should be separated by commas.

For example, the following command invokes the Kill method of processes to
end the Notepad process on the computer.

    $notepad = Get-Process notepad
    $notepad.Kill()

This example can be shortened by combining the above statements.

    (Get-Process Notepad).Kill()

The Get-Process command is enclosed in parentheses to ensure that it runs
before the Kill method is invoked. The Kill method is then invoked on the
returned Process object.

Another very useful method is the Replace method of strings. The Replace
method, replaces text within a string. In the example below, the dot (.)
can be placed immediately after the end quote of the string.

    'this is rocket science'.Replace('rocket', 'rock')

    this is rock science

As shown in the previous examples, you can invoke a method on an object
that you get by using a command, an object in a variable, or anything that
results in an object (like a string in quotes).

Starting in PowerShell 4.0, method invocation by using dynamic method names
is supported.


Learning about methods

To find definitions of the methods of an object, go to help topic for the
object type and look for its methods page. For example, the following page
describes the methods of process objects System.Diagnostics.Process.

To determine the arguments of a method, review the method definition, which
is like the syntax diagram of a PowerShell cmdlet.

A method definition might have one or more method signatures, which are
like the parameter sets of PowerShell cmdlets. The signatures show all of
the valid formats of commands to invoke the method.

For example, the CopyTo method of the FileInfo class contains the following
two method signatures:

        CopyTo(String destFileName)
        CopyTo(String destFileName, Boolean overwrite)

The first method signature takes the destination file name (and a path).
The following example uses the first CopyTo method to copy the Final.txt
file to the C:\Bin directory.

    (Get-ChildItem c:\final.txt).CopyTo("c:\bin\final.txt")

  [!NOTE] Unlike PowerShell's _argument_ mode, object methods execute in
  _expression_ mode, which is a pass-through to the .NET framework that
  PowerShell is built on. In _expression_ mode BAREWORD arguments (unquoted
  strings) are not allowed. You can see this difference when using a the
  path as a parameter, versus the path as an argument. You can read more
  about parsing modes in about_Parsing

The second method signature takes a destination file name and a Boolean
value that determines whether the destination file should be overwritten,
if it already exists.

The following example uses the second CopyTo method to copy the Final.txt
file to the C:\Bin directory, and to overwrite existing files.

    (Get-ChildItem c:\final.txt).CopyTo("c:\bin\final.txt", $true)


Methods of Scalar objects and Collections

The methods of one ("scalar") object of a particular type are often
different from the methods of a collection of objects of the same type.

For example, every process has a Kill method, but a collection of processes
does not have a Kill method.

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, PowerShell tries to prevent scripting errors
that result from the differing methods of scalar objects and collections.

If you submit a collection, but request a method that exists only on single
("scalar") objects, PowerShell invokes the method on every object in the
collection.

If the method exists on the individual objects and on the collection, only
the collection's method is invoked.

This feature also works on properties of scalar objects and collections.
For more information, see about_Properties.

Examples

The following example runs the KILL method of individual process objects in
a collection of objects.

The first command starts three instances of the Notepad process.
Get-Process gets all three instance of the Notepad process and saves them
in the $p variable.

    Notepad; Notepad; Notepad
    $p = Get-Process Notepad
    $p.Count

    3

The next command runs the KILL method on all three processes in the $p
variable. This command works even though a collection of processes does not
have a Kill method.

    $p.Kill()
    Get-Process Notepad

The Get-Process command confirms that the Kill method worked.

    Get-Process : Cannot find a process with the name "notepad". Verify the proc
    ess name and call the cmdlet again.
    At line:1 char:12
    + Get-Process <<<<  notepad
        + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (notepad:String) [Get-Process]
    , ProcessCommandException
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NoProcessFoundForGivenName,Microsoft.PowerShel
    l.Commands.GetProcessCommand

This example is functionally equivalent to using the Foreach-Object cmdlet
to run the method on each object in the collection.

    $p | ForEach-Object {$_.Kill()}

ForEach and Where methods

Beginning in PowerShell 4.0, collection filtering using a method syntax is
supported. This allows use of two new methods when dealing with collections
ForEach and Where.

You can read more about these methods in about_arrays


Calling a specific method when multiple overloads exist

Consider the following scenario when calling .NET methods. If a method
takes an object but has an overload via an interface taking a more specific
type, PowerShell chooses the method that accepts the object unless you
explicitly cast it to that interface.

    Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'

       // Interface
       public interface IFoo {
         string Bar(int p);
       }

       // Type that implements the interface
       public class Foo : IFoo {

       // Direct member method named 'Bar'
       public string Bar(object p) { return $"object: {p}"; }

       // *Explicit* implementation of IFoo's 'Bar' method().
       string IFoo.Bar(int p) {
           return $"int: {p}";
       }

    }
    '@

In this example the less specific object overload of the BAR method was
chosen.

    [Foo]::new().Bar(1)

    object: 1

In this example we cast the method to the interface IFOO to select the more
specific overload of the BAR method.

    ([IFoo] [Foo]::new()).Bar(1)

    int: 1


Using .NET methods that take filesystem paths

PowerShell supports multiple runspaces per process. Each runspace has its
own _current directory_. This is not the same as the working directory of
the current process: [System.Environment]::CurrentDirectory.

.NET methods use the process working directory. PowerShell cmdlets use the
Runspace location. Also, .NET methods only work with native filesystem
paths, not PowerShell Path objects. To use PowerShell paths with .NET
methods, you must resolve the path to a filesystem-native path before
passing it to the .NET method.
