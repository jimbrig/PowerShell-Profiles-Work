ABOUT_OUTPUT_STREAMS


Short description

Explains the availability and purpose of output streams in PowerShell.


Long description

PowerShell provides multiple output streams. The streams provide channels
for different types of messages. You can write to these streams using the
associated cmdlet or redirection. For more information, see
about_Redirection.

PowerShell supports the following output streams.

  Stream #   Description          Introduced in    Write Cmdlet
  ---------- -------------------- ---------------- -------------------
  1          SUCCESS stream       PowerShell 2.0   Write-Output
  2          ERROR stream         PowerShell 2.0   Write-Error
  3          WARNING stream       PowerShell 3.0   Write-Warning
  4          VERBOSE stream       PowerShell 3.0   Write-Verbose
  5          DEBUG stream         PowerShell 3.0   Write-Debug
  6          INFORMATION stream   PowerShell 5.0   Write-Information
  n/a        PROGRESS stream      PowerShell 3.0   Write-Progress

  [!NOTE] The PROGRESS stream does not support redirection.


Success stream

The SUCCESS stream is the default stream for normal, successful results.
Use the Write-Output cmdlet to explicitly write objects to this stream.
This stream is used for passing objects through the PowerShell pipeline.
The SUCCESS stream is connected to the STDOUT stream for native
applications.


Error stream

The ERROR stream is the default stream for error results. Use the
Write-Error cmdlet to explicitly write to this stream. The ERROR stream is
connected to the STDERR stream for native applications. Under most
conditions, these errors can terminate the execution pipeline. Errors
written to this stream are also added the the $Error automatic variable.
For more information, see about_Automatic_Variables.


Warning stream

The WARNING stream is intended for error conditions that are less severe
than errors written to the ERROR stream. Under normal conditions, these
warnings do not terminate execution. Warnings are not written to the $Error
automatic variable. Use the Write-Warning cmdlet to explicitly write to
this stream.


Verbose stream

The VERBOSE stream is intended for messages that help users troubleshoot
commands as they are run interactively or from a script. Use the
Write-Verbose cmdlet to explicitly write messages to this stream. Many
cmdlets provide verbose output that is useful for understanding the
internal workings of the cmdlet. The verbose messages are output only when
you use the -Verbose common parameter. For more information, see
about_CommonParameters.


Debug stream

The DEBUG stream is used for messages that help scripters understand why
their code is failing. Use the Write-Debug cmdlet to explicitly write to
this stream. The debug messages are output only when you use the -Debug
common parameter. For more information, see about_CommonParameters.

Debug messages are intended for script and cmdlet developers more than end
users. These debug messages can contain internal details necessary for deep
troubleshooting.


Information stream

The INFORMATION stream is intended to provide message that help a user
understand what a script is doing. It can also be used by developers as an
additional stream used to pass information through PowerShell. The
developer can tag stream data and have specific handling for that stream.
Use the Write-Information cmdlet to explicitly write to this stream.


Progress stream

The PROGRESS stream is used for messages that communicate progress in
longer running commands and scripts. Use the Write-Progress cmdlet to
explicitly write messages to this stream. The PROGRESS stream does not
support redirection.
