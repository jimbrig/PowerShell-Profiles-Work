Short description

Explains how to disconnect and reconnect to a PowerShell Session
(PSSession).


Long description

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, you can disconnect from a PSSession and
reconnect to the PSSession on the same computer or a different computer.
The session state is maintained and commands in the PSSession continue to
run while the session is disconnected.

The Disconnected Sessions feature is only available when the remote
computer is running PowerShell 3.0 or a later version.

The Disconnected Sessions feature allows you to close the session in which
a PSSession was created, and even close PowerShell, and shut down the
computer, without disrupting commands running in the PSSession.
Disconnected sessions are useful for running commands that take an extended
time to complete, and provides the time and device flexibility that IT
professionals require.

You can't disconnect from an interactive session that is started by using
the Enter-PSSession cmdlet.

You can use disconnected sessions to manage PSSessions that were
disconnected unintentionally as the result of a computer or network outage.

In real-world use, the Disconnected Sessions feature allows you to begin
solving a problem, turn your attention to a higher priority issue, and then
resume work on the solution, even on a different computer in a different
location.


Disconnected session cmdlets

The following cmdlets support the Disconnected Sessions feature:

-   Connect-PSSession: Connects to a disconnected PSSession.
-   Disconnect-PSSession: Disconnects a PSSession.
-   Get-PSSession: Gets PSSessions on the local computer or on remote
    computers.
-   Receive-PSSession: Gets the results of commands that ran in
    disconnected sessions.
-   Invoke-Command: INDISCONNECTEDSESSION parameter creates a PSSession and
    disconnects immediately.


How the Disconnected Sessions feature works

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, PSSessions are independent of the sessions in
which they're created. Active PSSessions are maintained on the remote
computer or SERVER-SIDE of the connection, even if the session in which the
PSSession was created is closed and the originating computer is shut down
or disconnected from the network.

In PowerShell 2.0, the PSSession is deleted from the remote computer when
it's disconnected from the originating session or the session in which it
was created ends.

When you disconnect a PSSession, the PSSession remains active and is
maintained on the remote computer. The session state changes from RUNNING
to DISCONNECTED. You can reconnect to a disconnected PSSession from the
current session or from a different session on the same computer, or from a
different computer. The remote computer that maintains the session must be
running and be connected to the network.

Commands in a disconnected PSSession continue to run uninterrupted on the
remote computer until the command completes or the output buffer fills. To
prevent a full output buffer from suspending a command, use the
OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE parameter of the Disconnect-PSSession,
New-PSSessionOption, or New-PSTransportOption cmdlets.

Disconnected sessions are maintained in the disconnected state on the
remote computer. They're available for you to reconnect, until you delete
the PSSession, such as by using the Remove-PSSession cmdlet, or until the
idle timeout of the PSSession expires. You can adjust the idle timeout of a
PSSession by using the IDLETIMEOUTSEC or IDLETIMEOUT parameters of the
Disconnect-PSSession, New-PSSessionOption, or New-PSTransportOption
cmdlets.

Another user can connect to PSSessions that you created, but only if they
can provide the credentials that were used to create the session, or use
the RunAs credentials of the session configuration.


How to get PSSessions

Beginning in PowerShell 3.0, the Get-PSSession cmdlet gets PSSessions on
the local computer and remote computers. It can also get PSSessions that
were created in the current session.

To get PSSessions on the local computer or remote computers, use the
COMPUTERNAME or CONNECTIONURI parameters. Without parameters, Get-PSSession
gets PSSession that were created in the local session, regardless of where
they terminate.

When getting PSSessions, remember to look for them on the computer on which
they're maintained, that is, the remote or SERVER-SIDE computer.

For example, if you create a PSSession to the Server01 computer, get the
session from the Server01 computer. If you create a PSSession from another
computer to the local computer, get the session from the local computer.

The following command sequence shows how Get-PSSession works.

The first command creates a session to the Server01 computer. The session
resides on the Server01 computer.

    New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01

    Id Name      ComputerName  State    ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------  -----    -----------------     ------------
     2 Session2  Server01      Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell     Available

To get the session, use the COMPUTERNAME parameter of Get-PSSession with a
value of Server01.

    Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server01

    Id Name      ComputerName  State    ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------  -----    -----------------     ------------
     2 Session2  Server01      Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell     Available

If the value of the COMPUTERNAME parameter of Get-PSSession is localhost,
Get-PSSession gets PSSessions that terminate at and are maintained on the
local computer. It doesn't get PSSessions on the Server01 computer, even if
they were started on the local computer.

    Get-PSSession -ComputerName localhost

To get sessions that were created in the current session, use the
Get-PSSession cmdlet without parameters. In this example, Get-PSSession
gets the PSSession that was created in the current session and connects to
the Server01 computer.

    Get-PSSession

    Id Name      ComputerName  State    ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------  -----    -----------------     ------------
     2 Session2  Server01      Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell     Available


How to disconnect sessions

To disconnect a PSSession, use the Disconnect-PSSession cmdlet. To identify
the PSSession, use the SESSION parameter, or pipeline a PSSession from the
New-PSSession or Get-PSSession cmdlets to Disconnect-PSSession.

The following command disconnects the PSSession to the Server01 computer.
Notice that the value of the STATE property is DISCONNECTED and the
AVAILABILITY is NONE.

    Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 | Disconnect-PSSession

    Id Name      ComputerName  State         ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------  -----         -----------------     ------------
     2 Session2  Server01      Disconnected  Microsoft.PowerShell          None

To create a disconnected session, use the INDISCONNECTEDSESSION parameter
of the Invoke-Command cmdlet. It creates a session, starts the command, and
disconnects immediately, before the command can return any output.

The following command runs a Get-WinEvent command in a disconnected session
on the Server02 remote computer.

    Invoke-Command -ComputerName Server02 -InDisconnectedSession -ScriptBlock {
       Get-WinEvent -LogName "*PowerShell*" }

    Id Name      ComputerName  State         ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------  -----         -----------------     ------------
     4 Session3  Server02      Disconnected  Microsoft.PowerShell          None


How to connect to disconnected sessions

You can connect to any available disconnected PSSession from the session in
which you created the PSSession or from other sessions on the local
computer or other computers.

You can create a PSSession, run commands in the PSSession, disconnect from
the PSSession, close PowerShell, and shut down the computer. Hours later,
you can open a different computer, get the PSSession, connect to it, and
get the results of commands that ran in the PSSession while it was
disconnected. Then you can run more commands in the session.

To connect a disconnected PSSession, use the Connect-PSSession cmdlet. Use
the COMPUTERNAME or CONNECTIONURI parameters to identify the PSSession, or
pipeline a PSSession from Get-PSSession to Connect-PSSession.

The following command gets the sessions on the Server02 computer. The
output includes two disconnected sessions, both of which are available.

    Get-PSSession -ComputerName Server02

    Id Name      ComputerName   State         ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------   -----         -----------------     ------------
     2 Session2  juneb-srv8320  Disconnected  Microsoft.PowerShell          None
     4 Session3  juneb-srv8320  Disconnected  Microsoft.PowerShell          None

The following command connects to Session2. The PSSession is now open and
available.

    Connect-PSSession -ComputerName Server02 -Name Session2

    Id Name      ComputerName    State    ConfigurationName     Availability
    -- ----      ------------    -----    -----------------     ------------
     2 Session2  juneb-srv8320   Opened   Microsoft.PowerShell     Available


How to get the results

To get the results of commands that ran in a disconnected PSSession, use
the Receive-PSSession cmdlet.

You can use Receive-PSSession rather than using the Connect-PSSession
cmdlet. If the session is already reconnected, Receive-PSSession gets the
results of commands that ran when the session was disconnected. If the
PSSession is still disconnected, Receive-PSSession connects to it and then
gets the results of commands that ran while it was disconnected.

Receive-PSSession can return the results in a job (asynchronously) or to
the host program (synchronously). Use the OUTTARGET parameter to select JOB
or HOST. The default value is HOST. However, if the command that's being
received was started in the current session as a JOB, it's returned as a
JOB by default.

The following command uses the Receive-PSSession cmdlet to connect to the
PSSession on the Server02 computer and get the results of the Get-WinEvent
command that ran in the Session3 session. The command uses the OUTTARGET
parameter to get the results in a JOB.

    Receive-PSSession -ComputerName Server02 -Name Session3 -OutTarget Job

    Id   Name   PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location
    --   ----   -------------   -----         -----------     --------
     3   Job3   RemoteJob       Running       True            Server02

To get the job's results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.

    Get-Job | Receive-Job -Keep

    ProviderName: PowerShell

    TimeCreated             Id LevelDisplayName Message     PSComputerName

    5/14/2012 7:26:03 PM   600 Information      Provider "W Server02
    5/14/2012 7:26:03 PM   600 Information      Provider "C Server02
    5/14/2012 7:26:03 PM   600 Information      Provider "V Server02


State and Availability properties

The STATE and AVAILABILITY properties of a disconnected PSSession tell you
whether the session is available for you to reconnect to it.

When a PSSession is connected to the current session, its state is OPENED
and its availability is AVAILABLE. When you disconnect from the PSSession,
the PSSession state is DISCONNECTED and its availability is NONE.

The value of the STATE property is relative to the current session. A value
of DISCONNECTED means that the PSSession isn't connected to the current
session. But, it doesn't mean that the PSSession is disconnected from all
sessions. It might be connected to a different session.

To determine whether you can connect or reconnect to the PSSession, use the
AVAILABILITY property. A value of NONE indicates that you can connect to
the session. A value of BUSY indicates that you can't connect to the
PSSession because it's connected to another session.

The following example is run in two PowerShell sessions on the same
computer. Note the changing values of the STATE and AVAILABILITY properties
in each session as the PSSession is disconnected and reconnected.

    # Session 1

    # Idle Timeout

Disconnected sessions are maintained on the remote computer until you
delete them, such as by using the Remove-PSSession cmdlet, or they time
out. The IDLETIMEOUT property of a PSSession determines how long a
disconnected session is maintained before it's deleted.

PSSessions are idle when the HEARTBEAT THREAD receives no response.
Disconnecting a session makes it idle and starts the IDLETIMEOUT clock,
even if commands are still running in the disconnected session. PowerShell
considers disconnected sessions to be active, but idle.

When creating and disconnecting sessions, verify that the idle timeout in
the PSSession is long enough to maintain the session for your needs, but
not so long that it consumes unnecessary resources on the remote computer.

The IDLETIMEOUTMS property of the session configuration determines the
default idle timeout of sessions that use the session configuration. You
can override the default value, but the value that you use can't exceed the
MAXIDLETIMEOUTMS property of the session configuration.

To find the value of the IDLETIMEOUTMS and MAXIDLETIMEOUTMS values of a
session configuration, use the following command format.

    Get-PSSessionConfiguration |
      Format-Table Name, IdleTimeoutMs, MaxIdleTimeoutMs

You can override the default value in the session configuration and set the
idle timeout of a PSSession when you create a PSSession and when you
disconnect.

If you're a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer, you
can create and change the IDLETIMEOUTMS and MAXIDLETIMEOUTMS properties of
session configurations.


Idle timeout values

The idle timeout value of session configurations and session options is in
milliseconds. The idle timeout value of sessions and session configuration
options is in seconds.

You can set the idle timeout of a PSSession when you create the PSSession
(New-PSSession, Invoke-Command) and when you disconnect from it
(Disconnect-PSSession). However, you can't change the IDLETIMEOUT value
when you connect to the PSSession (Connect-PSSession) or get results
(Receive-PSSession).

The Connect-PSSession and Receive-PSSession cmdlets have a SESSIONOPTION
parameter that takes a SESSIONOPTION object, such as one returned by the
New-PSSessionOption cmdlet. The IDLETIMEOUT value in SESSIONOPTION object
and the IDLETIMEOUT value in the $PSSessionOption preference variable don't
change the value of the IDLETIMEOUT of the PSSession in a Connect-PSSession
or Receive-PSSession command.

To create a PSSession with a particular idle timeout value, create a
$PSSessionOption preference variable. Set the value of the IDLETIMEOUT
property to the desired value (in milliseconds).

When you create PSSessions, the values in $PSSessionOption variable take
precedence over the values in the session configuration.

For example, the following command sets an idle timeout of 48 hours:

    $PSSessionOption = New-PSSessionOption -IdleTimeoutMSec 172800000

To create a PSSession with a particular idle timeout value, use the
IDLETIMEOUTMSEC parameter of the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet. Then, use the
session option in the value of the SESSIONOPTION parameter of the
New-PSSession or Invoke-Command cmdlets.

The values set when creating the session take precedence over the values
set in the $PSSessionOption preference variable and the session
configuration.

For example:

    $o = New-PSSessionOption -IdleTimeoutMSec 172800000
    New-PSSession -SessionOption $o

To change the idle timeout of a PSSession when disconnecting, use the
IDLETIMEOUTSEC parameter of the Disconnect-PSSession cmdlet.

For example:

    Disconnect-PSSession -IdleTimeoutSec 172800

To create a session configuration with a particular idle timeout and
maximum idle timeout, use the IDLETIMEOUTSEC and MAXIDLETIMEOUTSEC
parameters of the New-PSTransportOption cmdlet. Then, use the transport
option in the value of the TRANSPORTOPTION parameter of
Register-PSSessionConfiguration.

For example:

    $o = New-PSTransportOption -IdleTimeoutSec 172800 -MaxIdleTimeoutSec 259200
    Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Test -TransportOption $o

To change the default idle timeout and maximum idle timeout of a session
configuration, use the IDLETIMEOUTSEC and MAXIDLETIMEOUTSEC parameters of
the New-PSTransportOption cmdlet. Then, use the transport option in the
value of the TRANSPORTOPTION parameter of Set-PSSessionConfiguration.

For example:

    $o = New-PSTransportOption -IdleTimeoutSec 172800 -MaxIdleTimeoutSec 259200
    Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Test -TransportOption $o


Output buffering mode

The output buffering mode of a PSSession determines how command output is
managed when the output buffer of the PSSession is full.

In a disconnected session, the output buffering mode effectively determines
whether the command continues to run while the session is disconnected.

The valid values as follows:

-   BLOCK. When the output buffer is full, execution is suspended until the
    buffer is clear. The default value.
-   DROP. When the output buffer is full, execution continues. As new
    output is generated, the oldest output is discarded.

BLOCK preserves data, but might interrupt the command. A value of DROP
allows the command to complete, although data might be lost. When using the
DROP value, redirect the command output to a file on disk. This value is
recommended for disconnected sessions.

The OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE property of the session configuration determines
the default output buffering mode of sessions that use the session
configuration.

To find a session configuration's value of the OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE, you can
use either of the following command formats:

    (Get-PSSessionConfiguration <ConfigurationName>).OutputBufferingMode

    Get-PSSessionConfiguration | Format-Table Name, OutputBufferingMode

You can override the default value in the session configuration and set the
output buffering mode of a PSSession when you create a PSSession, when you
disconnect, and when you reconnect.

If you're a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer, you
can create and change the output buffering mode of session configurations.

To create a PSSession with an output buffering mode of DROP, create a
$PSSessionOption preference variable in which the value of the
OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE property is DROP.

When you create PSSessions, the values in $PSSessionOption variable take
precedence over the values in the session configuration.

For example:

    $PSSessionOption = New-PSSessionOption -OutputBufferingMode Drop

To create a PSSession with an output buffering mode of DROP, use the
OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE parameter of the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet to create a
session option with a value of DROP. Then, use the session option in the
value of the SESSIONOPTION parameter of the New-PSSession or Invoke-Command
cmdlets.

The values set when creating the session take precedence over the values
set in the $PSSessionOption preference variable and the session
configuration.

For example:

    $o = New-PSSessionOption -OutputBufferingMode Drop
    New-PSSession -SessionOption $o

To change the output buffering mode of a PSSession when disconnecting, use
the OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE parameter of the Disconnect-PSSession cmdlet.

For example:

    Disconnect-PSSession -OutputBufferingMode Drop

To change the output buffering mode of a PSSession when reconnecting, use
the OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE parameter of the New-PSSessionOption cmdlet to
create a session option with a value of DROP. Then, use the session option
in the value of the SESSIONOPTION parameter of Connect-PSSession or
Receive-PSSession.

For example:

    $o = New-PSSessionOption -OutputBufferingMode Drop
    Connect-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -Name Test -SessionOption $o

To create a session configuration with a default output buffering mode of
DROP, use the OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE parameter of the New-PSTransportOption
cmdlet to create a transport option object with a value of DROP. Then, use
the transport option in the value of the TRANSPORTOPTION parameter of
Register-PSSessionConfiguration.

For example:

    $o = New-PSTransportOption -OutputBufferingMode Drop
    Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Test -TransportOption $o

To change the default output buffering mode of a session configuration, use
the OUTPUTBUFFERINGMODE parameter of the New-PSTransportOption cmdlet to
create a transport option with a value of DROP. Then, use the Transport
option in the value of the SESSIONOPTION parameter of
Set-PSSessionConfiguration.

For example:

    $o = New-PSTransportOption -OutputBufferingMode Drop
    Set-PSSessionConfiguration -Name Test -TransportOption $o


Disconnecting loopback sessions

Loopback sessions, or local sessions, are PSSessions that originate and
terminate on the same computer. Like other PSSessions, active loopback
sessions are maintained on the computer on the remote end of the connection
(the local computer), so you can disconnect from and reconnect to loopback
sessions.

By default, loopback sessions are created with a network security token
that doesn't permit commands run in the session to access other computers.
You can reconnect to loopback sessions that have a network security token
from any session on the local computer or a remote computer.

However, if you use the ENABLENETWORKACCESS parameter of the New-PSSession,
Enter-PSSession, or Invoke-Command cmdlet, the loopback session is created
with an interactive security token. The interactive token enables commands
that run in the loopback session to get data from other computers.

You can disconnect loopback sessions with interactive tokens and then
reconnect to them from the same session or a different session on the same
computer. However, to prevent malicious access, you can reconnect to
loopback sessions with interactive tokens only from the computer on which
they were created.


Waiting for jobs in disconnected sessions

The Wait-Job cmdlet waits until a job completes and then returns to the
command prompt or the next command. By default, Wait-Job returns if the
session in which a job is running is disconnected. To direct the Wait-Job
cmdlet to wait until the session is reconnected, in the OPENED state, use
the FORCE parameter. For more information, see Wait-Job.


Robust sessions and unintentional disconnection

A PSSession might be unintentionally disconnected because of a computer
failure or network outage. PowerShell attempts to recover the PSSession,
but its success depends upon the severity and duration of the cause.

The state of an unintentionally disconnected PSSession might be BROKEN or
CLOSED, but it might also be DISCONNECTED. If the value of STATE is
DISCONNECTED, you can use the same techniques to manage the PSSession as
you would if the session were disconnected intentionally. For example, you
can use the Connect-PSSession cmdlet to reconnect to the session and the
Receive-PSSession cmdlet to get results of commands that ran while the
session was disconnected.

If you close (exit) the session in which a PSSession was created while
commands are running in the PSSession, PowerShell maintains the PSSession
in the DISCONNECTED state on the remote computer. If you close (exit) the
session in which a PSSession was created, but no commands are running in
the PSSession, PowerShell doesn't attempt to maintain the PSSession.
