ABOUT_RESERVED_WORDS


Short description

Lists the reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers because they
have a special meaning in PowerShell.


Long description

There are certain words that have special meaning in PowerShell. When these
words appear without quotation marks, PowerShell attempts to apply their
special meaning rather than treating them as character strings. To use
these words as parameter arguments in a command or script without invoking
their special meaning, enclose the reserved words in quotation marks.

The following are the reserved words in PowerShell:

    assembly         exit            process
    base             filter          public
    begin            finally         return
    break            for             sequence
    catch            foreach         static
    class            from (*)        switch
    command          function        throw
    configuration    hidden          trap
    continue         if              try
    data             in              type
    define (*)       inlinescript    until
    do               interface       using
    dynamicparam     module          var (*)
    else             namespace       while
    elseif           parallel        workflow
    end              param
    enum             private

    (*) These keywords are reserved for future use.

Several language keywords, including Foreach, If, For, and While, have
their own help articles. To view them, type Get-Help about_ and add the
keyword. For example, to get information about the Foreach statement, type:

    Get-Help about_ForEach

For information about the Filter statement or the Return statement syntax,
type:

    Get-Help about_Functions

For information about other reserved words, type:

    Get-Help <Reserved_Word>

  [!NOTE] Not every reserved word has its own help article. If Get-Help
  does not return an article, you can search for articles that talk about
  the reserved word using the following command:

      Get-Help <Reserved_Word> -Category:HelpFile
