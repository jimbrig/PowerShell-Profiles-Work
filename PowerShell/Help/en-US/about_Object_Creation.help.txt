Short description

Explains how to create objects in PowerShell.


Long description

You can create objects in PowerShell and use the objects that you create in
commands and scripts.

There are many ways to create objects, this list is not definitive:

-   New-Object: Creates an instance of a .NET Framework object or COM
    object.
-   Import-Csv/ ConvertFrom-CSV: Creates custom objects (PSCUSTOMOBJECT)
    from the items defined as comma separated values.
-   ConvertFrom-Json: Creates custom objects defined in JavaScript Object
    Notation (JSON).
-   ConvertFrom-StringData: Creates custom objects defined as key value
    pairs.
-   Add-Type: Allows you to define a class in your PowerShell session that
    you can instantiate with New-Object.
-   New-Module: The ASCUSTOMOBJECT parameter creates a custom object you
    define using script block.
-   Add-Member: Adds properties to existing objects. You can use Add-Member
    to create a custom object out of a simple type, like [System.Int32].
-   Select-Object: Selects properties on an object. You can use
    Select-Object to create custom and calculated properties on an already
    instantiated object.

The following additional methods are covered in this article:

-   By calling a type's constructor using a static new() method
-   By typecasting hash tables of property names and property values


Static new() method

All .NET types have a new() method that allows you to construct instances
more easily. You can also see all the available constructors for a given
type.

To see the constructors for a type, specify the new method name after the
type name and press <ENTER>.

    [System.Uri]::new

    OverloadDefinitions
    -------------------
    uri new(string uriString)
    uri new(string uriString, bool dontEscape)
    uri new(uri baseUri, string relativeUri, bool dontEscape)
    uri new(string uriString, System.UriKind uriKind)
    uri new(uri baseUri, string relativeUri)
    uri new(uri baseUri, uri relativeUri)

Now, you can create a SYSTEM.URI by specifying the appropriate constructor.

    [System.Uri]::new("https://www.bing.com")

    AbsolutePath   : /
    AbsoluteUri    : https://www.bing.com/
    LocalPath      : /
    Authority      : www.bing.com
    ...

You can use the following sample to determine what .NET types are currently
loaded for you to instantiate.

    [AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() |
      ForEach-Object {
        $_.GetExportedTypes() |
          ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }
      }

Objects created using the new() method may not have the same properties as
objects of the same type that are created by PowerShell cmdlets. PowerShell
cmdlets, providers, and Extended Type System can add extra properties to
the instance.

For example, the FileSystem provider in PowerShell adds six NOTEPROPERTY
values to the DIRECTORYINFO object returned by Get-Item.

    $PSDirInfo = Get-Item /
    $PSDirInfo | Get-Member | Group-Object MemberType | Select-Object Count, Name

    Count Name
    ----- ----
        4 CodeProperty
       13 Property
        6 NoteProperty
        1 ScriptProperty
       18 Method

When you create a DIRECTORYINFO object directly, it does not have those six
NOTEPROPERTY values.

    $NewDirInfo = [System.IO.DirectoryInfo]::new('/')
    $NewDirInfo | Get-Member | Group-Object MemberType | Select-Object Count, Name

    Count Name
    ----- ----
        4 CodeProperty
       13 Property
        1 ScriptProperty
       18 Method

For more information about the Extended Type System, see
about_Types.ps1xml.

This feature was added in PowerShell 5.0


Create objects from hash tables

You can create an object from a hash table of properties and property
values.

The syntax is as follows:

    [<class-name>]@{
      <property-name>=<property-value>
      <property-name>=<property-value>
    }

This method works only for classes that have a parameterless constructor.
The object properties must be public and settable.

This feature was added in PowerShell version 3.0


Create custom objects from hash tables

Custom objects are very useful and are easy to create using the hash table
method. The PSCUSTOMOBJECT class is designed specifically for this purpose.

Custom objects are an excellent way to return customized output from a
function or script. This is more useful than returning formatted output
that cannot be reformatted or piped to other commands.

The commands in the Test-Object function set some variable values and then
use those values to create a custom object. You can see this object in use
in the example section of the Update-Help cmdlet help topic.

    function Test-Object {
      $ModuleName = "PSScheduledJob"
      $HelpCulture = "en-us"
      $HelpVersion = "3.1.0.0"
      [PSCustomObject]@{
        "ModuleName"=$ModuleName
        "UICulture"=$HelpCulture
        "Version"=$HelpVersion
      }
      $ModuleName = "PSWorkflow"
      $HelpCulture = "en-us"
      $HelpVersion = "3.0.0.0"
      [PSCustomObject]@{
        "ModuleName"=$ModuleName
        "UICulture"=$HelpCulture
        "Version"=$HelpVersion
      }
    }
    Test-Object

The output of this function is a collection of custom objects formatted as
a table by default.

    ModuleName        UICulture      Version
    ---------         ---------      -------
    PSScheduledJob    en-us          3.1.0.0
    PSWorkflow        en-us          3.0.0.0

Users can manage the properties of the custom objects just as they do with
standard objects.

    (Test-Object).ModuleName

     PSScheduledJob
     PSWorkflow


Create non-custom objects from hash tables

You can also use hash tables to create objects for non-custom classes. When
you create an object for a non-custom class, the namespace-qualified type
name is required, although you may omit any initial SYSTEM namespace
component.

For example, the following command creates a session option object.

    [System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSSessionOption]@{
      IdleTimeout=43200000
      SkipCnCheck=$True
    }

The requirements of the hash table feature, especially the parameterless
constructor requirement, eliminate many existing classes. However, most
PowerShell _option_ classes are designed to work with this feature, as well
as other very useful classes, such as the PROCESSSTARTINFO class.

    [System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo]@{
      CreateNoWindow="$true"
      Verb="run as"
    }

    Arguments               :
    ArgumentList            : {}
    CreateNoWindow          : True
    EnvironmentVariables    : {OneDriveConsumer, PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE,
                               CommonProgramFiles(x86), APPDATA...}
    Environment             : {[OneDriveConsumer, C:\Users\user1\OneDrive],
                               [PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE, AMD64],
                               [CommonProgramFiles(x86),
                               C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files],
                               [APPDATA, C:\Users\user1\AppData\Roaming]...}
    RedirectStandardInput   : False
    RedirectStandardOutput  : False
    RedirectStandardError   : False
    ...

You can also use the hash table feature when setting parameter values. For
example, the value of the SESSIONOPTION parameter of the New-PSSession.
cmdlet can be a hash table.

    New-PSSession -ComputerName Server01 -SessionOption @{
      IdleTimeout=43200000
      SkipCnCheck=$True
    }
    Register-ScheduledJob Name Test -FilePath .\Get-Inventory.ps1 -Trigger @{
      Frequency="Daily"
      At="15:00"
    }


Generic objects

You can also create generic objects in PowerShell. Generics are classes,
structures, interfaces, and methods that have placeholders (type
parameters) for one or more of the types that they store or use.

The following example creates a DICTIONARY object.

    $dict = New-Object 'System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[String,Int]'
    $dict.Add("One", 1)
    $dict

    Key Value
    --- -----
    One     1

For more information on Generics, see Generics in .NET.
